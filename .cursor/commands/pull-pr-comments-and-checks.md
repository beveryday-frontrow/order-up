Use GH CLI to get PR comments and status checks rollup. Address all comments. If the comment is from bugbot or cursor you need to address it by solving the issues or proving that the issue is incorrect, reply to the comment with resolution, use gh api to set the comments to resolved (isResolved: true), after all comments have been resolved pull the latest checks and investigate any failures. Fix any issues and push up changes. Then poll the checks and comments, repeating if necessary.
